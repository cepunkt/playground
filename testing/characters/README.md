- **`world_narrator.json`** - Canonical V3 world narrator implementation
- **`elena_torres.json`** - Purposefully bad designed character example (average story trap)
- **Test cases** - Specific validation scenarios

## Usage
These characters demonstrate practical application of theoretical frameworks. Use as starting points for your own implementations.

**Status**: Working examples validated through group chat testing
