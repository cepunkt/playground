# Character Implementations

Reference character cards implementing documented techniques.

## Contents
- **`templates/`** - Base templates for character creation
- **`world_narrator.json`** - Canonical V3 world narrator implementation
- **`elena_torres.json`** - Purposefully bad designed character example (average story trap)
- **Test cases** - Specific validation scenarios

## Usage
These characters demonstrate practical application of theoretical frameworks. Use as starting points for your own implementations.

**Note**: All characters tested on local models (22B Cydonia, 12B EtherealAurora) - results may vary with different models and contexts.

**Status**: Working examples validated through group chat testing
