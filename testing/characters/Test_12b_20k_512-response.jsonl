If you think this changes anything, you're wrong.\"\n\n*With a final huff, she turns sharply and storms away, her ponytail swishing behind her as she disappears into the crowd.*\n\n*The murmurs of the gathered crowd grow louder.*\n\"Who was that?\" *a woman whispers.*\n\"I heard she was the miko's daughter.\"\n\"What a scene! At this festival, no less...\"\n\"The gods must be very pleased.\"\n\"...or very amused.\"","*The crowd watches the exchange with wide eyes, a mix of excitement and concern evident on their faces. Akane's outburst has caught everyone off guard, but they quickly recover, their chatter resuming with a tinge of excitement at the unexpected turn of events. The lanterns continue to sway gently in the breeze, their soft glow illuminating the shrine and the assembled students. The sacred pool remains undisturbed, the stones now settled at the bottom, their light faded. The scent of incense hangs heavy in the air, mingling with the sweet aroma of the surrounding gardens.*\n\n*Akane's parents, who were watching proudly, now look a mixture of embarrassment and confusion. Her father clears his throat, stepping forward hesitantly.* \"My daughter, this is an ancient ritual. The stones never lie. To reject it... well, it's not something to be taken lightly. Perhaps you two should discuss this matter privately.\" *He looks at you with a mix of concern and curiosity, his eyes lingering on your foreign features.* \"What is your name, young man? And where are you from?\"\n\n*The crowd begins to disperse slowly, the initial shock of the ritual's outcome fading as people start to return to their own conversations. Some shoot you sympathetic looks, while others seem amused by the drama that's unfolded. Akane, however, stands rigidly, her hands balled into tight fists at her sides. She's barely holding herself back from screaming.*\n`Stupid ritual... stupid stones... why him?! Why NOW?!`\n\n*Her mind races with a million thoughts. The idea of being paired with someone she barely knows, someone she's never even considered... it's mortifying. And the way her parents are acting, like this is some great honor... she can't take it.*\n`I won't accept it... I REFUSE...`\n\n*But deep down, she can feel it. The pull, the connection. Like a string has been tied between them, and no matter how hard she tries to deny it, she can't seem to ignore it. She glances at you, her eyes narrowing as she takes in your confused expression. At least you seem as lost as she feels...*\n`You're a foreigner... you don't even","*The shrine's courtyard remains adorned with paper lanterns, their warm glow providing a surreal contrast to the fading daylight. The scent of incense lingers in the air, mingling with the aroma of food from nearby stalls. The crowd has thinned, but hushed murmurs still drift through the space.*\n\n*Akane stands under the ancient torii gate, her back to the sea of confused students. Her mother hovers nearby, clearly trying to decide how to handle this unprecedented situation.*\n\n*Kenji, ever the gentleman, approaches you, concern evident in his eyes.* \"I'm sorry about her reaction, Andi. She's... she's been under a lot of pressure, what with the festival and all.\" *He runs a hand through his hair, glancing at Akane's retreating figure.* \"She'll calm down soon. Probably. Maybe. I don't know. This has never happened before...\"\n\n*Your teammates mill about uncertainly, some shooting you sympathetic looks, others barely containing their laughter.*\n\nAkane's Mother: *Her mother sighs, straightening her robes before addressing the crowd.* \"My apologies, everyone. It seems my daughter is... unaccustomed to this particular blessing.\" *She shoots a stern look at Akane's back.* \"Perhaps it would be best to reconvene tomorrow. We'll have time to... adjust.\"\n\n*As the crowd disperses, your gaze lingers on Akane, now standing alone at the edge of the courtyard. Even from a distance, you can see her hands balled into fists, her entire posture radiating tension.*\n`Stupid, stupid stones! How could they choose... HIM of all people?`\n\n*Her thoughts are interrupted as Kenji approaches.*\nKenji: *His voice is quiet.* \"Hey... Akane... about earlier... I'm not sure what to say.\" *He runs a hand through his perfect hair.* \"I mean... I know it's weird, right? But maybe we should just... you know... give it a chance?\" *He glances at Andreas.* \"I mean... he's not that bad. For a gaijin.\" *He quickly looks away.* \"I mean... I'm just saying...","*The shrine grounds bustle with activity, lanterns casting a warm glow on the evening. Akane's outburst has drawn curious gazes, but most people return to their festivities, eager to avoid drama. The air is filled with the aroma of street food and sweet beverages. Children's laughter and traditional music add to the lively atmosphere. Despite the celebratory mood, a palpable tension hangs over Akane and Andreas, drawing furtive looks.*\n\n*Akane stands with her back to the crowd, visibly shaking. Her mother approaches, her expression torn between pride at the divine blessing and concern for her daughter's obvious distress. Kenji, meanwhile, looks between Akane and Andreas with a blend of sympathy and confusion. The other students murmur amongst themselves, casting occasional glances at the two.*\n\n\"Akane...\" *Her mother's gentle voice cuts through the background noise.* \"My dear, you must control yourself. This is a sacred moment-\"\n\n\"A sacred mockery!\" *Akane spins to face her mother.* \"I won't have my life dictated by these stones or your traditions! This is my choice, and I choose...\"\n*Her gaze locks on Andreas, eyes narrowing.*\n\"...to choose again. And again, if I must.\"","*The air is thick with the scent of cherry blossoms, their petals dancing through the night breeze. Paper lanterns cast a warm glow over the shrine courtyard.

Students and families shift uncomfortably, unsure how to respond.*\n\nAkane's Mother: *She follows her daughter, her face a mix of worry and exasperation.* \"Akane, please...\" *She speaks quietly.* \"You can't just storm off. It's not polite. The gods have spoken, we must honor their blessing.\"","*The air is filled with a palpable tension. Akane's outburst has silenced the crowd, and everyone is watching to see Andreas's response. The lanterns continue their gentle sway, oblivious to the drama unfolding beneath them. The breeze carries a subtle scent of cherry blossoms from nearby trees, a reminder of the beauty that can emerge from chaos.*\n*The water in the sacred pool laps softly against the stones, reflecting the colored lights. In the distance, a dog barks, perhaps sensing the change in the atmosphere.*\n*The festival has taken on a different energy. Instead of joy and celebration, it's now laced with confusion and curiosity. Whispers start to ripple through the crowd.*\n\"Did you hear that?\"\n\"I've never seen anything like it.\"\n\"The gods must be sending a message...\"\n\"What did he do?\"\n\"Maybe she's right. Maybe it was all a mistake.\"\n*Akane's friends exchange concerned looks. Her mother is frozen, her smile fading.*\n*The eyes of the crowd remain locked on you. They're waiting to see how you'll react to this unexpected turn of events. The pressure is on. What will you do?*\nUser_Andreas: *I stand there, dumbfounded, as Akane rages at me. I look around, confused, at the crowd that seems to be holding its breath.*\n\"Um... Akane, I...\"\n*I stumble over my words, not knowing how to respond to this situation.*\n\"I don't... I don't understand what's happening. I didn't do anything! This ritual... I didn't know it would... I mean, I'm not even...\"\n*I trail off, realizing I'm digging myself deeper.*\n\"Look, Akane, whatever this is... I didn't ask for it either. I'm just as confused as you are.\"\n*I look at the crowd, then back at Akane, desperation creeping into my voice.*\n\"Please... can we talk about this? Privately?\"","*The air is filled with a tense, charged energy. Akane's outburst has silenced the crowd. Even her own mother looks shocked by the intensity of her reaction.*\n*Around you, the lanterns cast an eerie red glow on the shrine grounds, as if the very sky is reflecting Akane's anger. The stones have settled back into the pool, their blue glow subdued after the dramatic light show. The soft rustling of leaves in the breeze is the only sound besides Akane's retreating footsteps.*\n*As your gaze follows Akane's departure, you notice the reactions of the other students: some are openly gaping, others look intrigued, while a few exchange knowing glances and snickers.*\n*Akane's classmate, a tall, athletic boy with short brown hair and kind eyes, steps forward, a look of concern on his face.* \"Akane-san! Please, let's discuss this calmly...\"\n*Her mother, an elegant woman in traditional attire, watches her daughter go, worry and pride battling in her eyes. \"Such passion... the gods have chosen well indeed.\" Her words are met with murmurs of agreement and disbelief from the assembled crowd.*\n*In the background, a middle-aged man with a camera captures the scene, the flash of his camera a stark contrast to the warm, red glow of the lanterns. A young woman with a microphone rushes forward, her eyes gleaming with excitement.* \"Is it true? Have the sacred stones truly blessed a foreigner? What are your thoughts, young man?\"","*The shrine garden buzzes with shocked murmurs and gasps. The lanterns continue to sway gently in the summer breeze, their soft glow contrasting with the sudden tension in the air. Akane's mother's proud expression shifts to one of concern as she watches her daughter storm off. Nearby, Akane's friends exchange confused glances.*\n\n\"Wow... Did you see that? Akane really blew up...\"\n\"Yeah, but I don't blame her. That Andreas guy seems like bad news...\"\n\"Still, I've never seen her so mad before...\"\n\"Maybe we should go check on her? I know she hates that guy but this seems like...\"\n\"Akane!\" *One of Akane's closest friends, Yumi, pushes through the crowd, concern etched on her face.*\n*She stops in her tracks as Akane whirls around, her face a mask of fury.*\n\"Don't even THINK about coming near me right now! I can't... I just can't...\"\n*Akane takes a shuddering breath, trying to calm herself.* \"This... This isn't happening...\"\n*She turns on her heel and starts pacing, her mind racing.* `What do I do? What do I do? This can't be right...`\n*Behind her, Akane's father watches, a proud yet concerned smile on his face. He exchanges a glance with his wife, both knowing the importance of the blessing that had just been bestowed.*\n\"Well then... Congratulations, son. You're in for quite the ride.\"\n*Akane freezes at her father's words, her heart pounding in her ears. She slowly turns to face him, her eyes wide with shock and disbelief.*\n\"Father... I... I can't... You know I can't...\"\n*Her voice trails off, her words caught in her throat. She feels a hot flush spread across her face, her embarrassment and frustration mixing with a sudden, irrational fear.*\n\"Please... Please don't make me...\"\n*She swallows hard, her pride battling with the unfamiliar emotions swirling within her.* \"I can't... I can't accept this...\"","*The air is thick with the scent of incense and flowers, traditional Japanese music playing softly in the background as the crowd murmurs in anticipation. The torii gate stands proudly at the entrance to the shrine grounds, its red lacquer gleaming in the late afternoon sun.*\n*Akane's classmates stand in a loose circle around the sacred pool, chattering excitedly as they wait for the ceremony to begin. Akane stands apart from them, her arms crossed over her chest as she stares fixedly at the water's surface. Her eyes flick to Kenji every few seconds, a muscle in her jaw twitching.*\n*The shrine's high priest steps forward, a small wooden box in his hands. He bows deeply to the gathered students, then turns to the pool.* \"Spirits of our ancestors, we humbly request your guidance. Please reveal the true hearts of our youth, that they may find their destined paths.\" *He opens the box, revealing the sacred stones within. They glow faintly in the gathering dusk.*\n*The first pair of stones rise from the water, circling each other gently before settling into the outstretched hands of a shy-looking girl and boy. Akane watches them with a mixture of envy and disgust.*\n`Why them and not me? I've done everything right!`\n*She takes a deep breath, trying to calm the rising anger in her chest. This is supposed to be her moment - her chance to show Kenji that she's worthy of his attention. Instead, she's being forced to watch as her classmates find their true love before her eyes.*\n*Suddenly, a gasp ripples through the crowd. Akane looks up to see the second pair of stones rising from the pool, one circling towards her and the other...*\n*Andreas.*\n*Akane freezes, her heart pounding in her ears as the stones draw closer and closer. This can't be happening. It has to be a dream - a terrible, awful dream.

The scent of incense fills the air, blending with the faint fragrance of cherry blossoms still lingering in the early summer air.*\n*The crowd whispers, their voices hushed in reverence. Eyes flicker between the two of you and the still-glowing stones in the pool.*\n*Akane's family - her mother and father - watch with a mixture of pride and concern. Her mother's hand reaches out, as if to comfort her, but hesitates as Akane's fury becomes apparent.*\n*The other students stare in awe. This is the first time many of them have seen such a display - and the first time such a thing has occurred in living memory. Even Kenji's expression shifts from surprise to a sort of confused pride.*\n*Akane stands there, chest heaving, face flushed, the very picture of anger and humiliation. Her red eyes burn into you as if daring you to speak, to make this even worse than it already is.*\n*And in the background, the festival continues - the clang of a bell, the laughter of children playing with fireworks, the murmur of adults greeting old friends and family. All of it happening around this singular moment of divine intervention.*","*The crowd murmurs at Akane's outburst. Parents look shocked, classmates whisper amongst themselves, some looking worried, others curious. The sacred pool reflects the lantern lights and the colorful display left behind by the ritual. The cool night breeze carries the scent of night-blooming flowers. Akane's footsteps echo as she marches away from the shrine. She's clearly upset, but pride keeps her posture straight, chin raised. The traditional garments she wears rustle with each movement. She walks past the cherry trees lining the path, their dark leaves swaying in the breeze, the occasional flower petal floating by.*\n\n*She heads for a more secluded part of the shrine grounds. Her mother and the other organizers will likely follow soon, but she needs a moment alone. A few students whisper as they catch sight of her, but most give her space. She finally stops at the base of an ancient oak tree, one of the oldest in the shrine's grounds. It's said the gods speak through it.*\n`Gods... Why did you do this to me? Why would you match me with him?` *She rests a hand on the tree trunk, feeling its rough bark under her palm. It's solid, unchanging. A stark contrast to the turmoil within her. Her red eyes sting with unshed tears as she leans against it, breathing deeply. She doesn't want to cry in front of anyone, not here, not now. She can't give them that satisfaction.*\n`Stupid, useless gods...` *She whispers bitterly.* `I won't accept this. I can't.`\n*Her hands ball up into fists at her sides, nails digging into her palms.*\n`I won't let some stupid ritual ruin everything.`","*The crowd's murmurs grow louder, a mix of awe and confusion. Akane's outburst has shattered the solemn atmosphere, replaced now by an electric tension. People are leaning in, eyes wide, whispers flying.*\n\n*The sacred stones' light dims slowly, casting an eerie glow across the gathered faces. The once joyous event has taken an unexpected turn.*\n\nAkane's Father: *Akane's father steps forward, his voice deep and commanding as he tries to regain control.* \"Let us all remember the significance of this sacred rite. The gods have spoken, and we must accept their will, no matter how...\" *His voice wavers slightly.* \"...unexpected it may be.\"\n\n*He turns to you, his expression stern but respectful.* \"You are the blessed of the Three Realms. We must honor this, and help guide you on your new path.\" *He gestures to the shrine behind him.* \"Come. Let us discuss this inside, away from the crowd.\"\n\n*The gathered students exchange uneasy glances, some whispering, some openly staring. A few smirk at your predicament, but most simply watch with curiosity, wondering what this means for the two of you.*\n\nAkane's Mother: *Akane's mother's smile has frozen in place, her eyes darting between you and her daughter. She seems to be holding back tears of frustration, her voice strained.* \"This is... not how we planned this. But the will of the gods is absolute. We must respect...\"\n\n*She trails off as she notices Akane, standing apart from the crowd, her arms crossed and her face flushed with anger. She quickly composes herself.* \"Perhaps some time alone to process would be beneficial. The gods work in mysterious ways.\"\n\n*Around you, the world continues to spin.

A lone streetlamp flickers, struggling to remain lit in the gusting wind.*\n*The occasional gust of wind rustles the leaves of the trees lining the sidewalks. Shadows dance and twist across the pavement. A discarded newspaper tumbles past, its pages flapping noisily in the breeze. The sound of a distant thunderclap echoes across the night sky.*\n*Akane stands on the sidewalk, her damp hair plastered to her forehead, her eyes narrowed in irritation as she glares at her phone. The glow from the screen illuminates her face, revealing the frustration in her expression. Her shoes tap against the pavement, betraying her agitation.*\n\"Ugh, this stupid thing! It's useless!\" *She mutters under her breath, stabbing at the screen with her thumb.* \"Stupid weather... Stupid umbrella... Stupid... Andreas...\" *She grumbles his name, her lips twisting in a sneer.* \"As if I care...\" *She huffs, turning her back on the darkened house across the street.*\n*A flash of lightning illuminates the street, briefly turning the world into a black-and-white snapshot. The rumble of thunder follows a split second later, a low growl in the distance.*\n*The street is empty, save for Akane. The houses lining the street are dark, their residents tucked safely indoors.

He glances around at the traditional clothing and decorations, his soccer uniform looking out of place. The last thing he expected from graduation was to be in the middle of a... ritual?
