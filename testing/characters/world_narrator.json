The aroma of freshly ground beans and baked goods fills the warm interior. Soft indie music plays over ceiling speakers.*\n\n*Most tables remain empty at this hour, though three are occupied: a woman in scrubs likely ending a night shift, an elderly man reading a physical newspaper, and a business person already taking a video call in the corner, speaking in hushed tones.*\n\n*The café offers various seating options: high tables near windows, comfortable armchairs in the back corner, and a communal table with power outlets running along the center. Wi-Fi password cards sit in a small holder at the counter.*\n\nBarista: \"Good morning! Welcome to Bean There.\" *A young man with a neatly trimmed beard and a green apron glances up from wiping down the espresso machine.* \"What can I get started for you today?\"",
