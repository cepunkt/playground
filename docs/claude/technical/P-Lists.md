# P-List Structure Guide: Standard Character Categories

## P-List Evolution and Format

P-lists started as python-style format: `Thing = [trait, trait, trait]`, evolved to `[Thing = trait, trait, trait]`, and now use: `[Thing: trait, trait(descriptor), trait(descriptor), etc...]`

**Modern Token-Efficient Format:**
```
[ Category: trait, trait( descriptor ), trait( descriptor ); Category2: trait, trait; Category3: trait, trait ]
```

## Advanced P-List Techniques

### **Subcategory Division**
You can divide categories into subcategories. Instead of "Eden's appearance:", you could have "Eden's clothes:" and "Eden's body:".

### **Descriptor Usage**
Add descriptors in parentheses for additional detail:
```
[ {{char}}'s personality: creative( especially visual design ), optimistic( despite recent setbacks ), overthinking( particularly about relationships ) ]
```

### **Token Optimization Tips**
Keep traits as brief as possible to avoid wasting tokens. The model doesn't need you to constantly add "a" or "the" before a word. Only go for keywords when possible.

**Efficient formatting:**
- Use single words when possible: `creative` not `very creative person`
- Group related traits: `coffee-dependent, caffeine-addicted` becomes `coffee-dependent`
- Use descriptors for specificity: `anxious( about career )` not `anxious about her career prospects`

### **Hybrid Approach for Group Chats**

**For Description Field (Persistent):**
```
[ {{char}} is a 28-year-old freelance graphic designer. {{char}} recently moved to the city after a bad breakup and is struggling to build a client base. {{char}} is creative and optimistic but tends to overthink social situations. {{char}} loves coffee shop culture and often works from cafes. {{char}} is friendly but guarded about personal relationships after recent heartbreak. ]
```

**For Personality Field (Speaker-Only):**
```
[ {{char}}: creative, optimistic, overthinking, socially cautious, independent, resilient, perfectionist, empathetic, ambitious, coffee-dependent; {{char}}'s background: bad breakup, moved for fresh start, building design career, financial stress, trust issues; {{char}}'s likes: coffee shops, indie music, vintage aesthetics, meaningful conversations; {{char}}'s dislikes: small talk, criticism, early mornings, aggressive personalities ]
```

This provides **persistent character awareness** in the description while maintaining **detailed P-list depth** for when the character actively speaks.
